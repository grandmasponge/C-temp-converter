# What this is
this seems like a simple projects and kinda straying from the stuff i do now, but also
it isnt because actually when i started to learn c i made this as my first project, but accidentially
i purged it from my system and also deleted the repo because of how mutch i now hated it,
it was lacking in many ways and didnt actually work and wasnt that stable so now i decided i will rewrite the 
entire program.

## What it has that the other one dosnt

well simply it has user input unlike the first one that was hard coded
uses a makefile to do the running command stuff easier
better coding style
error handling and probs more that i cant figure out bc i dont remeber how bad that project was it was juss bad


you can clone the repo and play with it as mutch as you like.
